# Real-time-object-detection-and-segmentation-using-Mask-RCNN
In this work, a model is designed which can detect the objects in videos and images and label them. The model works on COCO dataset using pretrained weights on resnet-101. The technique od masking is used along with object labelling using Mask-RCNN,instance segmentation and Computer Vision.
Samples folder contains the video file on which detection and segmentation is done.
